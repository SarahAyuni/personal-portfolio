<h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>

<p>
I will share my experience as a student in information management in University Technology Mara (UiTM). Information Management (IM) is an important area of content management which includes the retrieving, acquiring, organising and maintaining of information as well as the distribution and communication of information to the desired audience. Through this programme, it will focus on three divisions, namely library management, records management and information systems.I have acquired a lot of knowledge and many things I need to study in completing tasks throughout studying in this field. I look forward to further expanding the knowledge in this field to the degree level.</p>
